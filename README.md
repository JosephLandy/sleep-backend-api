# sleep-backend-api

This is the REST backend for my personal sleep tracking app (see the sleep-frontend repo for more info). It uses Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. 

The symlink file "shared" must point to the folder src/shared in the separate sleep-frontend project, and may require additional setup. 
It contains Typescript definitions and utilies shared between both projects.
